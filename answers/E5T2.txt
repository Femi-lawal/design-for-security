# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
CodeSpoilt: It has the capability to scan more than 95 security vulnerabilities across 40+ resource types consisting of a wide range of AWS products.
 
### Example vulnerability
- Servers exposed publicly to the internet


##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
Clair:  Clair is an API-driven analysis engine that inspects containers layer-by-layer for known security flaws. Clair scans each container layer and provides a notification of vulnerabilities that may be a threat, based on the CVE database and similar data feeds from Red Hat, Ubuntu, and Debian.

### Example vulnerability
- Clair can detect Network attack vectors such as CVE-2014-0160, aka "Heartbleed" which is an information disclosure flaw.


##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
Amazon Inspector enables Automated and continual vulnerability management at scale
