Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
Amazon insector:
All of the vulnerabilities are from the instances of the project
- Security Group WebAppSG does not restrict ssh access
- Security Group WebAppSG does not restrict rdp access
- Security Group WebAppSG has ports other than 443 and 80 open to the public internet.
- The EC2 instance RecipeWebServiceInstance Port range 0 to 65535 is reachable from an Internet Gateway

Security Hub:
The 3 buckets S3BucketVPCFlowLogs, S3BucketRecipesSecret and S3BucketRecipesFree all have the same 4 Findings
- Critical warning S3.8 S3 Block Public Access setting should be enabled at the bucket-level
- Medium warning S3.9 S3 bucket server access logging should be enabled
- Medium warning S3.5 S3 buckets should require requests to use Secure Socket Layer
- Medium warning S3.4 S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled

AWS Config:
It reveals non compliance for the 3 s3 buckets in the same areas as the findings in Security Hub
The instances RecipeWebServiceInstance and AttackInstance have the following noncompliance:
- This Amazon EC2 instances use IPv4 addresses.
- The Amazon EC2 instances are not managed by AWS Systems Manager.
- The Amazon EC2 instances are not configured to use the Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
- Update the security groups to disallow access on all ports to the instances from the Internet, except for 443 and 80.
- ssh and rdp access should be restricted to certain ip addresses or removed completely from the production system.
- Enable sever-side encryption on the S3 buckets
- Enable server-side access logging on the S3 buckets
- Update the permissions policy of the S3 bucket to allow only SSL requests.
- Configure the EC2 instances to use Amazon EC2 Instanec Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2).
- Configure the Amazon EC2 instances to be managed by AWS Systems Manager.
