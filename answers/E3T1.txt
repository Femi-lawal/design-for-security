# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
GuardDuty can detect unauthorized and unexpected activity in an AWS environment,
by analyzing and processing data from AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs to detect anomalies involving the following AWS resource types: IAM access keys, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and Amazon EKS resources.
While in transit from these data sources to GuardDuty, all of the log data is encrypted. 
GuardDuty extracts various fields from these logs for profiling and anomaly detection, and then discards the logs.
