# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
The RecipeWebServiceInstance can be moved to a private subnet thereby protecting it from public internet access

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No it would not, because the IAM permissions allows an attacker to perform any operation in any bucket.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No it will not, it only works for objects added after encryption was enabled.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
The environment would basically revert to it's original form at the start of the project.
